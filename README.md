🚀 Showcasing My Latest Power BI Project: Bank Loan Report (USA)
I'm thrilled to share my recent work on a comprehensive Power BI dashboard, analyzing bank loans across the USA. This project gave me the opportunity to dive deep into data visualization and provide actionable insights for financial decision-making. 🏦
📊 Key Highlights from the Report:
Total Loan Applications: 38.6K | Funded Amount: $435.8M
Good Loans Issued: 86.2% | Funded: $370.2M
Bad Loans Issued: 13.8% | Funded: $65.5M
The dashboard is structured into three pages:
Summary: High-level insights, including loan distributions and key metrics.
Overview: Detailed breakdown of loan data by state, loan grade, and purpose.
Details: In-depth analysis of loan performance, customer demographics, and risk factors.
This project allowed me to hone my skills in data visualization, data modeling, and advanced DAX calculations. I’m thrilled with how it turned out and excited about the actionable insights it can provide to financial institutions.
Feel free to connect if you’d like to discuss the project in more detail or explore potential collaborations!
